TumblrSharp
========

This is a continuation of the excellent [TumblrSharp](https://tumblrsharp.codeplex.com/) C# Library developed by [the community](https://tumblrsharp.codeplex.com/team/view).


Why?
========
TumblrSharp is a very nicely designed library, and perhaps the *only* usable C# library that currently exists.  However, development for the Codeplex project stopped in 2014.  While using the library, I've noticed several bugs which I'll fix and post to this repository.

What has been fixed?
========
- [x] Errors with getting submission posts and their new post `state` type
- [ ] Getting dashboard posts *after* a date rather than *before*

What needs to be implemented?
========
- [ ] Better documentation
- [ ] Examples of how to use the library
- [ ] Chat
